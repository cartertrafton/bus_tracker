To-Do:
	
- Read from JSON file and create HTML table format
	- maybe format table function as (in order to remove JSON buisness):
		getValuesFromWeb();
		makeTableFromValues();
		updateValuesButton();
- add fixed routes to map
	- learn polylines and routing from Leaflet
	- format of each route is array of GPS coordinate arrays
- track buses based on location data from table.js
	- add icon to last updated GPS location (Leaflet)
	- make bus icon
- highlight route on selection
	- on mouse click, change color and width, make other routes greyed out
		highlightRoute();
			change CSS of vectors (Leaflet research into how polylines are styled)
		clearHighlight();
			reset CSS
