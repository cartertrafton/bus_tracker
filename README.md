##### Resources and Process
Beginning this project I did not know any JavaScript, HTML, or CSS. I have used 
resources such as: 
- [Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org): for basic HTML, CSS, and JS.
- [Rithm](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses): for more advanced JavaScript.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp): for tons of CSS and HTML 
reference and tutorials.
